#Readme: Readable
This project is to allow people who are trying to learn a language to know whether or not a paricular article is within their reading abliity. It achieves this by taking in some text as an input, and then the program compares it against a personal dictionary for the user. If there are too many words that are unfamiliar to the user, then it advbies them not to read it. If there are only a few unknown words, then it gives the reader a list of those words so that they can look up those words before attempting the article.
Currently, this prject only works for English-language texts. That is because I'm a native English speaker, and it's easier for me to develop somethign that works in Engish. After I can get the code to work, my plan is to simply create dictionaries for the French language, and use it for my own personal French learning. 
Currently, the project uses a text file as an input for articles. The paln is to eventually change that to work with URLs instaed, which will be far more convenient.
Down the line, I would love to do a version of this that works with written Chinese. It will be interesting, because of the total lack of whitespace.
